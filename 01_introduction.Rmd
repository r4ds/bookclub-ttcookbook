# Introduction

**Learning objectives:**

- Introduce the book The Art of Data Visualization with `ggplot2` by Nicola Rennie and understand the overall structure of the book
- Explain how the book club works
- Afterwards, you may be able to decide whether this book is right for you
- Improve the way you create graphs in R using ggplot2 in terms of programming and design. 

## Who is this book aimed at? {-}

- Anyone who wishes to develop/improve their data viz skills in R. 
- It's super useful if you are familar with the `tidyverse`.  
- You DO NOT need to be experienced in `ggplot2`. 
- It could also be helpful for users who know how to do data viz in other languages (e.g., python) but wish how to do the same type of graphs in R.
